    ðŸ’¡ The forkJoin operator in RxJS is used to combine multiple observables and wait for all of them to emit a value,
    and then emit an array of the last emitted values from each observable. It essentially waits for all the observables
    to complete and collects their final values. <br>

    ðŸ’¡ When the forkJoin observable completes, the subscribe callback is called with the resulting array as the
    parameter. <br>
    ðŸ’¡ The forkJoin operator is commonly used in scenarios where you need to wait for multiple observables to complete
    and
    collect their final results before performing further operations.
    E.g. ngOnInit() <br>
    ðŸ’¡ The forkJoin operator will emit a single value containing an array of results when all the source observables
    complete successfully. If any of the source observables emit an error, the forkJoin operator will immediately
    propagate that error and will not emit a value.
