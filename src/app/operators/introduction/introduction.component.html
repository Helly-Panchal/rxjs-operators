  <p class="">
    ðŸ’¡ RxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation. Operators are the
    essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.
  </p>

  <h2>What are operators?</h2>
  <p>Operators are functions. There are two kinds of operators:</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pipeable Operators</strong> <br>

    A Pipeable Operator is a function that takes an Observable as its input and returns another Observable. It is a pure
    operation: the previous Observable stays unmodified. <br>

    <strong>Creation Operators</strong> <br>

    Creation operators are functions that can be used to create an Observable with some common predefined behavior or by
    joining other Observables. <br>

    <strong>Higher-order Observables</strong> <br>

    Observables most commonly emit ordinary values like strings and numbers, but surprisingly often, it is necessary to
    handle Observables of Observables, so-called higher-order Observables. But how do you work with a higher-order
    Observable? Typically, by flattening: by converting a higher-order Observable into an ordinary Observable.
